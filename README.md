# Time-Concentration Project dashboard


Dashboards to monitor PK activity with plots, tables and maps

The dashboard has several sections:

* Main Dashboard - a summary of the PK parameter and time-concentration relationship.
* Time-Concentration Overview - overview of time-dependent changes 
* Parameters Overview- monitoring of how the PK parameter changes over time
* Individual Profiles - a grid of plots, each representing a different individual
* Correlation Analysis - between the PK parameter and other variables, such as age, gender, or co-administered drugs
